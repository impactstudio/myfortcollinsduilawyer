I treat each client as though they are the only one. If you have been arrested, put my two-and-a-half decades of criminal defense experience to work so we can accomplish the most ideal result in your case.</p>

        <h3 class="subpage-subheading">CHALLENGING YOUR DUI ARREST AND ANY EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU</h3>

        <p>In DWI/DUI cases, the goal is to obtain a reduction of the charges against you or a dismissal of the case altogether. The results of your blood test, or breathalyzer may be challenged in court . In the event that there were issues with the urine, blood, or breath test used to quantify your blood alcohol concentration (BAC), or with field sobriety testing, there is a chance that your case may be dismissed of that conviction can be avoided. </p>

        <p>Another imperative question that should be explained in any DWI/DUI case is the reason the officer came into contact with you. Why were you stopped? As your attorney, be sure that I will thoroughly examine all steps of your arrest with the utmost attention to detail. If the DUI/DWI stop or arrest was not lawful, I will take the appropriate steps to ensure that your issue is appropriately presentd.</p>

        <p><strong>You are innocent of drunk driving until proven guilty.</strong></p>

        <p>A DUI is a confusing process. My criminal defense firm offers the education, experience and responsibility necessary to help you avoid prison time, and stop the suspension of your driver's license and other DUI disciplines. </p>

        <h3 class="subpage-subheading">VITAL STEPS TO PROTECT YOURSELF FOLLOWING A DWAI/DUI ARREST</h3>

        <p>Assuming that you have taken a breath test or refused a test of your blood or breath, the first thing to do if you have been arrested for DUI or DWAI is to visit the Colorado DMV to request a hearing to challenge the suspension of your driver's license. The criminal court proceeding is unique in relation to the DMV hearing for your DWI/DUI arrest. I will do whatever I can to save your driving privileges.</p>

        <p>If you don't request this hearing inside seven days of your DUI arrest, your driver's license will be suspended, regardless of whether or not the allegations against you are later rejected.</p>

        <p>Another helpful appraoch is to recall everything about the arrest that you can. You may even need to record this so you can remember details at a later date. Certain elements of your arrest, such as, field sobriety testing, may help me to figure out a more powerful defense.</p>

        <p>Remember that what's important in a DUI case is not whether you were drinking and driving, but if the prosecution has the proper evidence to demonstrate that you were driving while substantially incapable of operating your vehicle in a safe manner or impaired due to drugs or alcohol. This must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt. If you are charged with drunk driving, I will do my very best to persuede the court to impose a sentence other than incarceration.</p>
